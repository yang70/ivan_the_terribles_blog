# My New Blog!

I've got a lot to say, and now I have a place to say it!!!!!

Read all my amazing posts!!!!! You can load them into the app with: `rake load:blog`

Since I know you want to read them all, I designed my page to show EVERYTHING on the front page of the site!!!!!

I know it is a little slow (but totes worth it!!!!)... _Do you know how I can make it faster?_

# I'm feeling insecure...

Well, I got some requirements from marketing to make sure we distinguish between published and unpublished posts. I made some changes to the html and css.

But now security auditors are telling me I have some security vulnerabilities! They were able to use the strings below to hack my site!!!

What do I do to fix it???


XSS:
```
http://localhost:3000/posts?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search=archive&status=foo=%22bar%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%22p0wned!!!%22%29%3C/script%3E%3Cp%20data-foo
```

SQL Injection:

```
foo%' OR true) --
```
